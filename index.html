                correctAnswer: 'tunneling',
                explanation: "The tunneling migration technique encapsulates an IPv6 packet inside an IPv4 packet. Encapsulation assembles a message and adds information to each layer in order to transmit the data over the network. Translation is a migration technique that allows IPv6-enabled devices to communicate with IPv4-enabled devices using a translation technique similar to NAT for IPv4. The dual-stack migration technique allows IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks to coexist on the same network simultaneously."

                explanation: "In network virtualization, the control plane function of each network device is removed and is performed by a centralized controller. The controller then can communicate control plane functions to each of the network devices. This allows the network devices to focus all resources on forwarding plane functions."

The line vty 0 4 command is used to access the configuration mode for Telnet. The 0 and 4 parameters specify ports 0 through 4, or a maximum of five simultaneous Telnet connections.
